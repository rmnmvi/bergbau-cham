                            If you have consented to data processing, we process your personal data on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR or Art. 9 para. 2 lit. a GDPR, if special categories of data are processed according to Art. 9 para. 1 GDPR. In the case of explicit consent to the transfer of personal data to third countries, data processing is also based on Art. 49 para. 1 lit. a GDPR. If you have consented to the storage of cookies or to access to information in your terminal device (e.g. via device fingerprinting), data processing is additionally based on § 25 para. 1 TTDSG. The consent can be revoked at any time. If your data is required for the performance of a contract or for the implementation of pre-contractual measures, we process your data on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR. Furthermore, we process your data if this is necessary to fulfill a legal obligation on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c GDPR. Data processing may also be carried out on the basis of our legitimate interest according to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. The relevant legal bases in each individual case are provided in the following paragraphs of this privacy policy.

                            In the course of our business activities, we work with various external parties. In some cases, it is also necessary to transmit personal data to these external parties. We only pass on personal data to external parties if this is necessary for the fulfillment of a contract, if we are legally obliged to do so (e.g. passing on data to tax authorities), if we have a legitimate interest in the transfer according to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR or if another legal basis permits the data transfer. When using processors, we only pass on personal data of our customers on the basis of a valid contract for order processing. In the case of joint processing, a joint processing agreement is concluded.
