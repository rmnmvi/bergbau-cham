# FAQ Section
faq:
  title: "Frequently Asked Questions"
  questions:
    q1:
      question: "Which markets does Edelmetall Cham currently operate in?"
      answer: "Our primary market focus is Ghana, where we have established strong relationships with certified sellers and mining operations. Through our extensive global supply network, we are continuously expanding to additional markets across Africa, ensuring reliable sourcing of precious metals while maintaining the highest standards of compliance and ethical trading."
    
    q2:
      question: "How does Edelmetall Cham's purchasing process work?"
      answer: "As a buyer, we receive the seller's pro-forma invoice and arrange for the consignment to be accompanied to our designated refinery. After comprehensive assay testing confirms the quantity and purity, we process payment immediately based on the final commercial invoice. We handle all import documentation, customs clearance, and local taxes at our destination."
    
    q3:
      question: "What verification and assay procedures does Edelmetall Cham require?"
      answer: "All precious metals undergo comprehensive assay testing at our designated refineries to verify quantity and purity.

    q4:
      question: "How are insurance and security handled during transport?"
      answer: "Insurance costs to the destination are normally borne by the seller, remaining in effect until ownership transfer upon payment. We work with leading security firms including Brink's, Loomis, and Prosegur to ensure maximum protection during transport. The seller's representative accompanies the consignment to our facility for added security and verification."
    
    q5:
      question: "What are the requirements for sellers working with Edelmetall Cham?"
